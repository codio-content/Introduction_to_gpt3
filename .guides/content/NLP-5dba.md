## Definition: Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) lies at the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Its focus is to give computers the power to read written text and interpret spoken words just as humans can. This is done through the use of computational modeling of human language, which allows real-time analysis of data.

Some common forms of NLP that you may use on a regular basis:

* **Chatbots** - chatbots are used for customer service or even to help you learn a new language.
* **Virtual assistants** - assistants from Amazon, Apple, and Google allow you to interact with computing devices in a natural manner.
* **Online translation** - computers can properly translate text by understanding the larger context through NLP.
* **Spam checkers** - NLP can identify words and phrases that frequently suggest spam or a phishing attempt.
